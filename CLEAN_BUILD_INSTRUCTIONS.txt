IMPORTANT: To fix the SQL syntax error, follow these steps:

1. STOP the running Spring Boot application (if running)

2. DELETE the target folder:
   - Close your IDE or stop the application
   - Delete the entire "target" folder in the project root
   - Or use: Remove-Item -Path "target" -Recurse -Force in PowerShell

3. REBUILD the project:
   - In IntelliJ/Eclipse: Right-click project → Maven → Clean
   - Then: Right-click project → Maven → Compile
   - Or use Build → Rebuild Project

4. RESTART the application:
   - The table will be recreated with correct AUTO_INCREMENT
   - After first successful run, change ddl-auto to "update" in application.properties

The entity code is now correct - the issue was old compiled classes!
